Two Examples to demonstrate display of simple three dimensional meshes in the browser.

Can be used with chrome and firefox. IE seems to have some limitations still. 

# Example 1: Mono - Experiment for Desktop-Environments

The mesh consists of four elements, one of them containing CSG-cutouts.

The camera can be paned, tilted, zoomed with the mouse (left click).

The view port can be moved with Ctrl-Mouse or right-mouse-click.

# Example 2: Stereo - Experiment for Mobile VR-enabled environments

The mesh consists of four elements, one of them containing CSG-cutouts.

The mesh is displayed in stereo mode (one picture for each eye). 

A card-board or any other VR-device is required to display it cleanly.

The camera can be panned, tilted, zoomed with the gyroskop included in most mobile devices.
